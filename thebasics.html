        <h2><strong>History:</strong></h2>
        <p>The first recorded tea party was in England in 1662 to celebrate a royal marriage. Throughout the 1700s tea parties were enjoyed by English nobility. But towards the end of the century tea became more accessible with the rise of Coffeehouses.</p>

        <p>Tea parties increased in popularity in the coming centuries. Eventually they grew among the common people and became less elaborate and more informal. This led to a distinction between &ldquo;afternoon tea&rdquo; and &ldquo;high tea&rdquo;. Although high tea was actually for the common class and afternoon was for the nobility.</p>

            <li><strong>High tea:</strong></li>
            <p>A tea that’s served with a hearty dinner of meat, bread and vegetables. Originally for the working class after a hard day of labor.</p>
            <li><strong>Afternoon Tea:</strong></li>
            <p><em>A more casual tea, served with finger sandwiches and hors d’oeuvres (appetizers/finger foods), scones* and petite desserts.</em> </p>
